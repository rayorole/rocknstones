    "howItStarted": "How it started",
    "howItStartedBody": "Rock'n Stones began in 2012 when our founder, a gemologist and designer, became obsessed with black diamonds—their depth, rarity, and the way they defy the usual sparkle. What started as a side project in a Brooklyn studio grew into a full collection built around one idea: jewelry should be unapologetically bold.",
    "craftAndCuration": "Craft and curation",
    "craftBody": "We work with a small network of cutters and setters who share our standards. Every piece is hand-finished and inspected before it reaches you. We don't do mass production: each design is made in limited runs so you're wearing something that stands out, not something you'll see on everyone else.",
    "whyBlackDiamonds": "Why black diamonds",
    "whyBody": "Black diamonds are natural, opaque, and full of character. They don't rely on the same \"fire\" as white diamonds—they have their own presence. Our collection mixes these stones with white gold, platinum, and black rhodium so the metal and the gem feel intentional, not flashy. For us, that's the point: confident, lasting, a little mysterious.",
